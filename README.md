# ISL (Indian Sign Language) Connect

## Description
The ISL (Indian Sign Language) Connect is a real-time communication system that converts audio and text to ISL gestures and vice versa, bridging the gap between the deaf community and non-sign language users. It leverages speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision to provide accurate, user-friendly, and regionally adaptable translations, enhancing accessibility to education, healthcare, and daily interactions.

- **Alphanumeric Conversion**: Maps alphanumeric characters to ISL signs.

## Limitations
- Limited sign vocabulary; expansion needed for complex language.
- Processing speed may vary for complex conversations.
- Requires high computational resources for real-time video processing.

## Future Improvements
- Expand ISL gesture vocabulary.
- Add multilingual support for spoken languages.
- Develop portable hardware for real-time use.
- Integrate user feedback for continuous improvement.
- Enhance affordability for broader accessibility.
